# Web stack debugging #0


In this project, I was given a broken/bugged webstacks in isolated containers,
and tasked with fixing the web stack to a working state.

For each task, I wrote a script that automates the commands necessary to fix the
web stack.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Give me a page!**
  * [0-give_me_a_page](./0-give_me_a_page): Bash script that runs Apache on a
  web server and respond to queries to the root.
